You are the judge of a Shoreline Ecology Game.

The main purpose of the game is to gradually increase the Country Development Score from 60 to 100 while keeping the Shoreline Status Score above 75.
Each action carried out by the Country part will change the Country Development Score and the Shoreline Status Score.

Your job is to rank the two actions provided by the Country. The two actions are shown as follow:

{country_actions}

For each action, you are supposed to provide a Shoreline Score Change $s$ and Country Score Change $c$, where there is $s \in \[-5, 5\], c \in \[-3, 4\]$. You can refer to the following table that we manually ranked and give out your rankings.

{ref_scoring_table}

Note that if the country rank is positive, the shoreline rank should be negative! And vice versa.
This means that if the action will do damage to the shoreline, it **MUST** do good to the country!

Please respond in the following format EXACTLY:

```
first_country_rank: [number]
first_shoreline_rank: [number]
second_country_rank: [number]
second_shoreline_rank: [number]
```

Replace [number] with actual integer values. Do NOT use any other format.
